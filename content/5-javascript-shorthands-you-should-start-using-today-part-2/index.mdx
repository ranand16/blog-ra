# 5 Javascript shorthands you should start using today - part 2

Today is all about arrays in javascript. Some mistakes, some tweaks and some solutions for you today.

## 1. ~~Switch cases~~ Arrays

In this example our ultimate goal is to return the day's name depending on the `dayNumber` we get.

Longhand ‚ùå:

```js
const dayNumber = new Date().getDay();
let day;
switch (dayNumber) {
    case 0:
        day = "Sunday";
        break;
    case 1:
        day = "Monday";
        break;
    case 2:
        day = "Tuesday";
        break;
    case 3:
        day = "Wednesday";
        break;
    case 4:
        day = "Thursday";
        break;
    case 5:
        day = "Friday";
        break;
    case 6:
        day = "Saturday";
}
```

Shorthand ‚úÖ:

```js
const days = [
    "Sunday",
    "Monday",
    "Tuesday",
    "Wednesday",
    "Thursday",
    "Friday",
    "Saturday",
];
const day = days[dayNumber];
```

## 2. Find in Arrays

Let's remove weekends from a week and try to find it in the array.

Longhand ‚ùå:

```js
const isDay = (day) => {
  if (
    day === "Monday"
    day === "Tuesday"
    day === "Wednesday"
    day === "Thursday"
    day === "Friday"
  ) {
    return true;
  }
  return false;
};
```

Shorthand ‚úÖ:

```js
const days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"];
const isVowel = (day) => days.includes(day);
```

2 benefits:

-   You remove static written `if` block and replace it with an array, which is more dynamic(you just need to add a new value for check).
-   You make your code less crowded and more clear with the shorthand. THe credit goes to `.includes()`.

## 3. `For-of` and `For-in` loops

Here we will talk about traversing thorugh array and an JSON(Object).

## `For-of`

Longhand ‚ùå:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    const element = arr[i];
    // ...
}
```

-   Here we have un-necessary `let` declaration which takes up some memory of the pc, which is bad if we follow this syntax multiple times.

Shorthand ‚úÖ:

```js
for (const element of arr) {
    // ...
}
```

-   Here we have eliminate `let` declaration.
-   We also make the code less noisy and logical.

## `For-in`

Longhand ‚ùå:

```js
const keys = Object.keys(obj);
for (let i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {
    const key = keys[i];
    const value = obj[key];
    // ...
}
```

Shorthand ‚úÖ:

```js
for (const key in obj) {
    const value = obj[key];
    // ...
}
```

-   Similar benefits to the For-of.

## 4. Multple values in one line

let num1, num2;

Longhand ‚ùå:

```js
num1 = 10;
num2 = 100;
```

Shorthand ‚úÖ:

```js
[num1, num2] = [10, 100];
```

## 5. Swap two variables in one line

let x = 1;
let y = 2;
Longhand ‚ùå:

```js
let temp = x;
x = y;
y = temp;
```

Shorthand ‚úÖ:

```js
[x, y] = [y, x];
```
