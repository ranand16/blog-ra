This is part 2 of the media query series.
Here we will be discussing about orientation and print.

Let's have a basic html template here.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
        <title>Static Template</title>
        <style>
            /* Stylings goes here  */
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Body content goes here -->
    </body>
</html>
```

## 1. Orientation

Here background color changes to lightgreen when the screen orientation is portrait(height of screen is greater than width). This can be used to manipulate stylings for mobile screen as it has height greater than width.

```html {9-14,18}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
        <title>Orientation</title>
        <style>
            /* 1. Orientation media query  */
            @media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {
                body {
                    background-color: lightseagreen;
                }
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        Thie background color will change when you change the screen
        orientation.
    </body>
</html>
```

## 2. Print

Here I am displaying some content on the page only while printing. We will be using `@media print` keyword to define media query for same.
To see the output you will need to give the print command on your browser and see the print output.

### Use cases for print:

1. 1 - You would use print when you want some elements on the page not to be printed. Probably those elements can be header, footer or any other element.
2. 2 - One more use case could be when an airline company would also want some extra advertisment on a ticket when you print it.

There still might be many use cases left out which we can discuss later.

```html {16-25, 30-32}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
        <title>Print</title>
        <style>
            /* 1. Orientation media query  */
            @media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {
                body {
                    background-color: lightseagreen;
                }
            }

            /* 2. Print media query example  */
            .onlyOnPrint {
                display: none;
            }
            @media print {
                /* All your print styles go here */
                .onlyOnPrint {
                    display: block;
                }
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        Thie background color will change when you change the screen
        orientation.
        <p class="onlyOnPrint">Will be displayed only while printing</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
